Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no change in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on minutiae, I thought I would wander about 
a little and see the better part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the 
road and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the city; 
whenever it is a dark, gloomy November in my hometown; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
anticipating before **coffin time**, and bringing up the rear of every conclusion I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately spiraling into the darkness, and methodically 
tearing people's souls off—then, I account it high time to get to hell as soon as I can. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all beings in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the end with me.
